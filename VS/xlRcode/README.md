Monaco Editor UWP
=================
A *Windows Runtime Component* wrapper around the web-based [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).  This allows the Monaco Editor to be more easily consumed directly in XAML for C# UWP based projects.

This project is not affiliated with the Monaco team and is provided for convenience.  Please direct issues related to the use of this control wrapper to this repository.

This control is still in an early alpha state.  Currently, every minor version change may signal breaking changes.

Monaco API Notes
----------------
This project maintains two tenants with regards to the core web-based [Monaco API](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/index.html):

  1. Keep API names and patterns as closely mapped as possible to enable straight-forward re-usage of existing TypeScript examples.
  2. Swap types to existing C#/WinRT based ones for easier interop with the calling application.

Effectively, we want this project to be as easy to integrate with existing C#/WinRT skills/knowledge as possible as well as providing a similar enough API that it's easy to still utilize any existing knowledge bases for the Monaco API.

There are some common caveats though called out here:

  - Pretty much all functions are asynchronous and end with the C# `Async` naming suffix convention.
  - The `Monaco.Languages` namespace is mapped through the `CodeEditor` instance, so call `<Editor Instance>.Languages.*` for any of [those APIs](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/modules/monaco.languages.html). E.g.

    ```javascript
    // JavaScript
    monaco.languages.registerColorProvider("colorLanguage", ...
    ```

    ```csharp
    // C#
    var MonacoEditor = new CodeEditor(); // Either done through XAML or elsewhere once.
    ...
    MonacoEditor.Languages.RegisterColorProviderAsync("colorLanguage", ...
    ```
    This is required due to need to execute the code within a particular WebView instance hosting the Monaco control, there is no global execution context. Therefore, you must register any language providers individually to each `CodeEditor` instance.
  - Returns using `IAsyncOperation<T>` usually need to use the `AsyncInfo.Run` system interop helper. See Issue #45.
  - `Uri` class is not mapped yet to a built-in C# type. See Issue #33.
  - Keyboard Events can't use the built-in system `KeyRoutedEventArgs` class as it is sealed. (See https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/5475)
  - Decorations use CSS class names in Monaco, this has been ported to be a strongly-typed abstraction per type of styled element required for use of decorations. Each style type has a set or properties using common WinRT types associated with styling UI elements like `SolidColorBrush`, `TextDecoration`, `FontStyle`, etc... If a property is missing that you require, please open an issue or PR to modify the corresponding `ICssStyle` implementations.


Build Notes
-----------
Built using Visual Studio 2019 for Windows 10 17763 and above.

The **released** complete Monaco v0.21.3 build is used as a reference, this is not included in this repository and can be downloaded from the [Monaco site](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).  The contents of its uncompressed 'package' directory should be placed in the *MonacoEditorComponent/monaco-editor* directory.  The `install-dependencies.ps1` PowerShell script can install this for you automatically.

This component currently won't move beyond Monaco v0.22.3 as it is the last version compatible with the UWP WebView component running the Legacy Microsoft Edge engine. However, that version seems to have other issues running in Edge as well, so we have last tested with v0.21.3. In the future we'll investigate moving to WebView2.

In order to re-generate C# typings from a version of Monaco, see the GenerateMonacoTypings Node.js project [readme here](GenerateMonacoTypings/README.md).
